# U.S. Housing Insights Dashboard

## Projective Objective
To analyze U.S. housing data — including ownership, occupancy, and housing unit distribution — using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for dynamic reporting.
## Key Outcomes
- Executed 15+ SQL queries to extract, filter, and summarize regional and national housing data.

- Developed a Power BI dashboard with 10+ visuals showing ownership rates, occupancy trends, and housing gaps.

- Used ranking, CTEs, and calculations to compare 50+ U.S. regions.

- Delivered clear insights on homeownership distribution, housing shortages, and region-wise performance.

- Integrated SQL backend with Power BI frontend for a complete analytics solution.

## Insights from Analysis

- Some regions have homeownership rates >75%, while others fall below 50%, showing wide disparity.

- Identified regions with significant housing gaps (unoccupied units).

- Calculated each region’s contribution to national housing supply and occupancy.

- Ranked all regions by ownership rate and housing unit count.

## Final Conclusion
This project provides a dual-perspective insight into the sustainability landscape by combining electrification trends and housing data. The SQL-driven backend supports the Power BI visual layer, enabling stakeholders to make informed policy or business decisions around infrastructure, real estate, and clean energy adoption.
