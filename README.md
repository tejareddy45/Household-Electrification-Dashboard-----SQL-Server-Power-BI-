# Electrification & Housing Insights Dashboard

## Projective Objective
To analyze U.S. housing data and electric vehicle market trends using Power BI and SQL to uncover insights about housing occupancy, ownership patterns, and electrification progress.

## Key Outcomes
- Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard showcasing EV market dominance, range improvements, and regional patterns.

- Wrote 15+ optimized SQL queries to analyze national vs regional housing occupancy, ownership, and housing gaps.

- Integrated SQL and Power BI to support data-driven insights and interactive storytelling.

- Ranked regions based on homeownership rate, housing unit count, and gap metrics.

- Identified top and bottom performing regions using calculated fields and advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, ranking, etc.).

## Main Insights from Analysis
#### From SQL (Housing Data):
- National homeownership: X% (based on query #3).

- Top regions have >75% homeownership, while others fall below 50%.

- Significant housing gaps identified in multiple regions.

- Regional contributions to total housing vary widely (query #11 & #12).

#### From Power BI (EV Market):
- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) hold 72.3% of market share.

- Average EV range is 285 miles, easing range anxiety.

- Top 5 models and regional performance highlight adoption trends.

## Final Conclusion
This project provides a dual-perspective insight into the sustainability landscape by combining electrification trends and housing data. The SQL-driven backend supports the Power BI visual layer, enabling stakeholders to make informed policy or business decisions around infrastructure, real estate, and clean energy adoption.
